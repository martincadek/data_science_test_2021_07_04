# Run
To run the code in the repository, please use RStudio and open the project using data_science_test_2021_07_04.Rproj file.

After opening the RStudio, please navigate to the master file called run.R and source or run all of the lines.

The code will initiate directory setup, clean data, and run number of algorithms. The algorithms may take some time to run depending on your CPU as cross-validation is utilised.

The final report is located in R/report.html.

The script also outputs number of plots into plots/.

Packages are version controlled using renv.

# Exercise Description
Expected time: 1Â½ hours
From the supplied dataset (USA_cars_datasets.csv) build a model to predict the price of a used car given the other information available in the data. The final model should be evaluated to determine the expected level of predictive performance.

The modelling and outputs should be developed in Python and supplied in a Jupyter notebook. This should be suitable for review with other Data Scientists so the steps and methods should be clear, but presentation is not a high priority.

This should be submitted to your interviews in advance of your second interview.
