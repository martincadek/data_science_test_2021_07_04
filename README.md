# Data Scientist Exercise
This exercise was submitted as part of an interview for data science role.

Expected time: 1Â½ hours
From the supplied dataset (USA_cars_datasets.csv) build a model to predict the price of a used car given the other information available in the data. The final model should be evaluated to determine the expected level of predictive performance.

The modelling and outputs should be developed in Python and supplied in a Jupyter notebook. This should be suitable for review with other Data Scientists so the steps and methods should be clear, but presentation is not a high priority.

This should be submitted to your interviews in advance of your second interview.
